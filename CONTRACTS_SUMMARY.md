# Bastion Protocol Smart Contracts - Testing & Deployment Summary

## Contracts Implemented

### Doma Chain Contracts (`packages/contracts-doma/contracts/`)
1. **ICircle.sol** - Interface for circle management, treasury, governance
2. **CircleFactory.sol** - Factory for deploying circles using minimal proxy pattern
3. **CircleTreasury.sol** - Multi-sig treasury with USDC management and proposal system
4. **AuctionAdapter.sol** - Interface with Doma auction contracts
5. **CircleVault.sol** - Secure NFT custody with multi-sig governance

### Avalanche Chain Contracts (`packages/contracts-avalanche/contracts/`)
1. **MirrorDomainNFT.sol** - ERC-721 representing Doma domain custody proof
2. **CollateralManager.sol** - Multi-asset collateral management with Chainlink integration
3. **LendingPool.sol** - Multi-asset lending pool with USDC.e and WAVAX support

### Mock Contracts for Testing
- **MockERC20.sol** - ERC-20 token mock (USDC, WAVAX)
- **MockERC721.sol** - ERC-721 NFT mock (Domain NFTs)
- **MockContracts.sol** - Auction, Vault, and Chainlink aggregator mocks

## Key Features Implemented

### Security Features
- ✅ Multi-signature governance
- ✅ Pausable functionality for emergency stops
- ✅ Reentrancy protection
- ✅ Access control (role-based and ownership)
- ✅ Slippage protection

### Gas Optimizations
- ✅ Minimal proxy pattern for circle deployment
- ✅ Batch operations for multiple transactions
- ✅ Efficient storage patterns

### Integration Points
- ✅ Chainlink price feeds integration
- ✅ Cross-chain event emissions for relayer
- ✅ Doma auction system integration
- ✅ OpenZeppelin security patterns

## Fixes Applied

1. **Import Fixes**
   - Fixed CircleFactory to properly import ICircle interface
   - Updated interface signatures for consistency

2. **Event Emission Fixes**
   - Fixed AuctionAdapter domain deposit/withdrawal events
   - Updated event parameters for proper cross-chain monitoring

3. **Test File Fixes**
   - Updated test files for Hardhat v3+ compatibility
   - Fixed contract address usage with `getAddress()`
   - Simplified TypeScript types for test compatibility

4. **Contract Integration**
   - Fixed interface mismatches between contracts
   - Ensured proper integration between CollateralManager and LendingPool
   - Updated CircleVault for proper NFT custody management

## Deployment Scripts

- **Doma**: `packages/contracts-doma/scripts/deploy.ts`
- **Avalanche**: `packages/contracts-avalanche/scripts/deploy.ts`

## Test Coverage

Test files created for:
- CircleTreasury functionality
- AuctionAdapter integration
- CircleVault multi-sig operations
- MirrorDomainNFT minting/burning

## Next Steps

1. **Compile and Test**: Run `pnpm compile` and `pnpm test` in each package
2. **Deploy to Testnet**: Use deployment scripts for testnet deployment
3. **Integration Testing**: Test cross-chain relayer functionality
4. **Security Audit**: Review contracts before mainnet deployment

All contracts are now ready for compilation, testing, and deployment!
