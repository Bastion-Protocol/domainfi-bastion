```solidity
// Reentrancy vulnerability example
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
    
    // VULNERABLE: External call before state update
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success);
    
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount; // State update after external call
